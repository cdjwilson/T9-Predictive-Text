# T9-Predictive-Text
This was a school assignment.
T9 Predictive Text program that was used in the old Nokia phones in order to make texting on the number keyboard easier.
In order to run the program it needs a dictionary of words to populate the Trie data structure, it then accepts a number that represents the word you want to spell.
If multiple words can be spelled with that sequence of numbers then you can hit # until you get the word you want.
